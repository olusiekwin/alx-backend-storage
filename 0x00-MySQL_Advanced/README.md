### More Info
Comments for your SQL file:
```sql
-- 3 first students in the Batch ID=3
-- because Batch 3 is the best!
SELECT id, name FROM students WHERE batch_id = 3 ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 3;
```

## Additional Information
- Use "container-on-demand" to run MySQL
- Credentials in the container are root/root
- How to import a SQL dump:
```bash
$ echo "CREATE DATABASE hbtn_0d_tvshows;" | mysql -uroot -p
$ curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/intranet-projects-files/holbertonschool-higher-level_programming+/274/hbtn_0d_tvshows.sql" -s | mysql -uroot -p hbtn_0d_tvshows
$ echo "SELECT * FROM tv_genres" | mysql -uroot -p hbtn_0d_tvshows
```
